    "In an undirected graph, the degree d(u) of a vertex u is the number of neighbors u has, or equivalently, the number of edges incident upon it.\n",

    "- Given: A simple graph with n≤103 vertices in the edge list format.\n",
    "- Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the sum of the degrees of i's neighbors.\n",

    "#### Simple Graph: \n",
    "As opposed to a multigraph, a simple graph is an undirected graph that has no loops and no more than one edge between any two different vertices. In a simple graph the edges of the graph form a set (rather than a multiset) and each edge is a distinct pair of vertices. In a simple graph with n vertices every vertex has a degree that is less than n (the converse, however, is not true — there exist non-simple graphs with n vertices in which every vertex has a degree smaller than n).\n",

    "####  Edge List Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains two numbers, the number of vertices n and the number of edges m, each of the following m lines contains an edge given by two vertices. The format can be used to specify directed and undirected graphs as well as weighted and unweighted graphs.\n",
